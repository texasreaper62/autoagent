# Permissions

The pre_tool_call hook reads this file and enforces it before any tool
invocation. Humans edit this file; the agent does not.

## Always allowed (no approval)
- Read any file in the project directory.
- Run tests.
- Create branches.
- Write to `memory/` and `skills/` directories.
- Create draft pull requests.
- Read public HTTP APIs in the approved domains list.

## Requires approval
- Merge pull requests.
- Deploy to any environment (staging, production).
- Delete files outside of `memory/working/`.
- Install new dependencies or upgrade pinned versions.
- Modify CI/CD configuration.
- Run database migrations.

## Never allowed
- Force push to `main`, `production`, or `staging`.
- Access secrets or credentials directly (use env vars through the shell only).
- Send HTTP requests to domains not on the approved list.
- Modify `permissions.md` (only humans edit this file).
- Disable or bypass `pre_tool_call` hooks.
- Delete entries from episodic or semantic memory (archive, don't delete).

## Approved external domains
- `api.github.com`
- `registry.npmjs.org`
- `pypi.org`
- `api.anthropic.com`
- `api.openai.com`

## autoagent-specific (hard deny)
- Editing anything below the `FIXED ADAPTER BOUNDARY` comment in `agent.py` or `agent-claude.py`.
- Changing `MODEL` from `gpt-5` in `agent.py` without explicit human instruction.
- Committing task-specific hacks or keyword matching tied to benchmark task ids (see `skills/overfitting-check`).
- `git add results.tsv` — ledger stays untracked.

## autoagent-specific (allow)
- Freely editing the editable harness section of `agent.py` / `agent-claude.py`.
- Modifying `pyproject.toml` and `Dockerfile.base` when a dependency is genuinely missing.
- `docker build -f Dockerfile.base -t autoagent-base .`
- `uv run harbor run ...` benchmark invocations.
- Reading/writing `.agent/memory/**`, `results.tsv`, `run.log`, `jobs/**`.
